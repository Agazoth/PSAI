# HikerAI

This sample demonstrates how to use the OpenAI with a `gpt-35-turbo` model, from a PowerShell script. Get a hiking recommendation from the AI model. It consists of a console application, running locally, that will send request to OpenAI. 

## Trying HikerAI

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `02-HikerAI` directory.
   
2. It's now time to try the PowerShell script. 
	```powershell
	.\02-HikerAI.ps1
	```

3. (Optional) Try modifying the `hikeRequest` changing the location so something you know, or the type of hike you like  to see the differences in the responses.
