# Hiking Benefits Summary

This sample demonstrates how to use OpenAI with a `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, from a PowerShell console script. Use the AI model to summarize a page of text to a few words. It consists of a console application, running locally, that will read the file `benefits.md` and send request to an OpenAI Service deployed in your Azure subscription to summarize it. 

## Trying Hiking Benefits

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `01-HikeBenefitsSummary` directory.
   
2. It's now time to try the PowerShell script.
	```powershell
	.\01-HikingBenefitsSummary.ps1

3. (Optional) Try to change the content of the file or the length of the summary to see the differences in the responses.
